How to use it?
---------------------

Simply download the repository and follow the *main_notebook.ipynb*. 'segmentation models pytorch' library is used as a main segmentation framework.

The [Spacenet6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06500) dataset needs to be downloaded prior to running the main notebook.
